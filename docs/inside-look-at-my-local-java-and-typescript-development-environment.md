# Inside look at how I set up my Java and Typescript Development Environment.



When it comes to becoming a good developer, having your go-to tools and being organized is essential when you do software projects. This article will give you a look at my laptop specifications, folder structures, software, and how I set up my computer to be as productive as possible.



## Laptop Specifications:

The hardware specifications matter more than operating system. Most of the popular development tools run almost on Microsoft Windows, Apple OS, or Linux.

I personally use a Macbook Pro 16" 64GB w/2TB drive.

I had been a Microsoft Windows user for years, And finally migrated to Apple-verse years ago, and I am happy I did. I enjoy having the Linux-like shell out of the box and love the Apple product ecosystem. As long as you have the following specifications or better, the machine should be suitable for development of complex solutions.



> For 2022:  
> I recommend the following specs or equivalent listed in order of importance:
>- Storage: 1TB drive
>- Memory:  32GB RAM
>- Screen Size: 16inch
>- Chipset: CPU 2.4 HZ 8 cores or more
>
> My development laptop is a 2019 MacBook Pro 2.4GHz 8-core Intel Core i9 with Retina display, 64GB DDR4, and 2TB SSD.



### Storage
The fastest storage you can get is always better! I think 1TB is good enough for most.

And I only recommend 2 TB or more if you  deal with a lot of large files or if your test locally a complex environment and maintain several large docker images.

Besides, programming, I do video stuff for fun, and I use up 1TB just on installations of software.



### Screen Size

I believe most programmers are pretty stationary and are plugged into one or two monitors. However, having the 16inch monitor is a nice to have when you need to go work at a remote locations.

If working at several locations is the norm, and you carry your machine around all day i suggest a 14inch monitor.
