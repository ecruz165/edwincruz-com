### Summary
I am a Lead Software Engineer delivering cloud solutions using Java and Typescript on the AWS Platform.

I am a enthusiastic architect and developer seeking complex projects that leverage my Java and Typescript foundation to bring next-generation
platforms to life. Skills range across several areas: software design, CI/CD pipeline design, strategic planning, project management, system
integration, information architecture, user-experience design, and extensive knowledge of frontend and backend technologies and frameworks.

Past solutions use Multithreading design patterns, Messaging and Batching implemented with core Java, Spring Boot, Spring Integration/Batch,
Hibernate, and Ehcache.

Most recent software projects leverage Angular and Spring Framework on the AWS platform: AWS CDK, AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, AWS
Gateway, Amazon Aurora RDS, S3, SQS, and SES. Additional APIs/frameworks used recently include Zoom API, Twilio API, Mailchimp API,
AirTable API, and JotForm API.
