# Recommended hardware specifications for Java and Typescript Development.

In 2022, you do not need what is considered currently a high-end computer to do software development. However, if you work on complex projects that require spinning up several virtual machines on your local development environment you will benefit from having a mid-level laptop or better. 

Also, if you use some coding tools that help with productivity like IntelliJ or eclipse or Visual Code loaded with plugins you may also benefit from having extra horsepower and memory.

The hardware specifications matter more than operating system. Most of the popular development tools run on Microsoft Windows, Apple OS, or Linux.

I personally use a Macbook Pro 16" 64GB w/2TB drive.

I had been a Microsoft Windows user for years, And finally migrated to Apple-verse years ago for its ecosystem. I also enjoy having the Linux-like shell out of the box. 

As long as you have the following specifications or better, the machine should be suitable for development of complex solutions.



### Recommend Specs For 2022:  
>  In order of importance, I recommend the following specification or equivalent listed:
>- Storage: 1TB drive
>- Memory:  32GB RAM
>- Screen Size: 16inch
>- Chipset: CPU 2.4 HZ 8 cores or more

My development laptop is a ---2019 MacBook Pro 2.4GHz 8-core Intel Core i9 with Retina display, 64GB DDR4, and 2TB SSD---.



### Storage
The fastest storage you can get is always better!

When you install a lot of large programs and deal with large files, you hard drive space is consumed very quickly. When developing locally, if you run the all the components locally with large test files you will easily consume alot of space.

> #### 1TB drive
> Good for most
 
> #### 2TB drive
> The option when you plan on working on complex systems or working with extremely large files i say go for 2TB

I fall in the extreme category, I do video stuff for fun, and I run multi-container environments for local development. I literally use up 1TB just on installations of software.


### Memory



### Screen Size

I believe most programmers are pretty stationary and are plugged into one or two monitors. However, having the 16inch monitor is a nice to have when you need to go work at a remote locations.

> #### 14inch / 15inch
> Good for most

> #### 16inch / 17inch
> Good for those where working at several locations is the norm, and you carry your machine around every day.







### Chipset
